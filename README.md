this is my own custom website made to look like a totally rad 90s website

you can customize it to your liking if you want to, i will try to update as much as i can

THIS SITE IS NOW HOSTED ON NEOCITIES  : https://welp64.neocities.org/ 

UPDATE (5/28/23): Neocities site has some slight changes to it, overall it's still the same.
